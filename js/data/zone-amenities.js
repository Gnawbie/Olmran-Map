// Maps a zone name (must match a name in zones.js) to the amenity ids present
// there (see amenities.js).
//
// Hospital(H)/Bank(B)/Shop(Sb)/Repair(Sm) tags were read directly off the
// source map's icon boxes, at native tile resolution. "Sm" is the Repair
// icon, not a shop subtype.
//
// zone-white/green/red/purple tags come from reference/Olmran_Kaid_
// Equipment_and_Stats.xlsx ("Equipment" sheet, Realm/Area columns), which
// lists which named zones contain rooms of each gear tier. Some zones
// (e.g. Field of Sorrow) have rooms of more than one tier, so they carry
// multiple zone-* tags — this is zone-level ("this area has some White
// rooms and some Green rooms"), not room-by-room precision. For exact
// pathway boundaries, use the dev "Trace tier path" tool instead, which
// draws real overlays at hand-picked coordinates.
//
// A couple of spreadsheet area names still don't exactly match zones.js
// ("Ruins of Helk" -> Ruins of Belh, "Dunes of Al'kafi" -> Dunes of Al'Rafi)
// — matched by hand assuming they refer to the same in-game location.
// (Terngild, Kercpa Lair, Azulago Village, and Timetold Range were originally
// transcribed differently here but corrected per tester feedback.)
//
// No "safe area" icon was identifiable anywhere on the map — add zones here
// (or via the dev drag-and-drop tagging tool) once that symbol is known.
